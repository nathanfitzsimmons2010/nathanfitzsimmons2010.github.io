### Cisco Packet Tracer Labs by Nathan Fitzsimmons
######  In this series of labs, I construct a virtual home lab using Cisco's Packet Tracer, documenting the process while guiding you through it. The aim is to demonstrate my networking skills and knowledge, while highlighting my attention to detail and written communication.
