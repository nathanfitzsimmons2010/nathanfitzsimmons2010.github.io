Initial Router Configuration Lab
Nathan Fitzsimmons

In this Cisco Packet Tracer lab we will configure two 2911 routers:
- Install HWIC-1GE-SFP and GLC-H-SMD Small Form-Factor Pluggable Gigabit Ethernet ports.
- Configure Hostnames for each router.
- Connect the routers with a fiber connection on the newly installed SFP interfaces.
- Plan and choose the correct subnet for the network.
- Configure the newly installed SFP interfaces with IP addresses.
- Write configuration to file.
