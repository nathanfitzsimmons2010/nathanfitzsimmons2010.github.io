###### Welcome to my portfolio. FINISH WRITING AN INTRO
### Cisco Packet Tracer Labs by Nathan Fitzsimmons
######  In this series of labs, I construct a virtual home lab using Cisco's Packet Tracer.  Documenting the process and guiding you through it, step by step. The aim is to demonstrate my networking skills and knowledge, while highlighting my attention to detail and written communication.
